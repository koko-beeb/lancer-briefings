# FOB SABER // 2.22.5014u
It's been a tense day as not only did their dropship get shot down, they also had to deal with numerous forces en-route to the destination of **FOB SABER**. Fresh and not yet battle-tested the squad manages to pull together though they do sadly lose a member from a heavily guarded and emplaced rainmaker that has been causing the approach vector to **FOB SABER** to be fraught with danger. 

Pushing through though, they finally get some respite inside and an addition to the squad codename "Panopticon", who will prove to be a valuable partner leading onwards. From here onwards though, its gonna be a hell of thing as not only do they have to disable the jamming covering **NOV ELYSIA**, they'll also have to find the captain and ambassador and the forces that took them...
