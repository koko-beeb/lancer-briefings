Sunil "Teacher" Volker is a 30 year-old professor specializing in computer science and computer engineering. Though teaching is his foremost passion, he realized that it was time to affect change on the frontlines when he realized that his students were expressing concern about the safety of their future. This inspired "Teacher" to join the Union and become a Lancer, using his skillset to teach lessons to those that would look to learn more about the danger they face, and to those that could use a bit more instruction on how to behave.
