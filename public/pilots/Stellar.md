Captain John Stellars is a star pilot for union, he has long served his role dutifully in the military gaining the rank that he has, though mech piloting is still new to him, he's picked it up quickly enough. John has always had a fascination with driving big vehicles, especially those that fly either in space or the air. As an airmen, him and his buddies would look down upon clunky mechs, and the grease monkeys that pilot them, but seeing as circumstances has changed and now Captain Stellars finds himself piloting one, perhaps he will gain an appreciation for it too.
