Pietro was just a down on his luck merc who had a debt he could never repay, so he was always indentured to the worst or most dangerous jobs that the group had to offer. His callsign, Panopticon, was due to his tactical awareness on the battlefield, able to keep tabs on every detail of the enemy as well as keep them locked down, as in a prison. His mech's name, Letters Home from the Garden of Stone, reflects how he's seen so many untimely deaths, of those who's final message to their family was from a graveyard. He always hoped he wouldn't meet the same fate.
